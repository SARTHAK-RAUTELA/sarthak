Question1- 	Explain the preprocessor directives used in the C program.



Answer 1 =



Preprocessor directives in C are commands that are processed by the C preprocessor before actual compilation begins.
They are not part of the standard C language but provide a way to include or exclude parts of the code, define constants, and perform other manipulations before the code is compiled.
Preprocessor directives start with a `#` symbol and are typically written at the beginning of a C program.

Here are some common preprocessor directives:

1. **#include:**
   - Used to include the contents of a file in the program.
   - Example: `#include <stdio.h>` includes the standard input/output functions.

2. **#define:**
   - Used to create symbolic constants or macros.
   - Example: `#define PI 3.1415` creates a symbolic constant PI with the value 3.1415.

3. **#ifdef, #ifndef, #endif, #else:**
   - Used for conditional compilation. Portions of code can be included or excluded based on whether a certain condition is defined.
   - Example:
     ```c
     #ifdef DEBUG
         // Debugging code
     #else
         // Release code
     #endif
     ```

4. **#ifdef, #ifndef, #undef:**
   - Used to check if a macro is defined or undefined.
   - Example:
     ```c
     #ifndef MAX
         #define MAX 100
     #endif
     ```

5. **#pragma:**
   - Provides implementation-specific directives to the compiler.
   - Example: `#pragma warning(disable: 4996)` disables a specific compiler warning.

6. **#error:**
   - Causes a compilation error with a specified error message.
   - Example: `#error "This feature is not supported"`

These directives are processed by the C preprocessor before the actual compilation of the code. 
They are powerful tools for code organization, conditional compilation, and customization of the compilation process.
